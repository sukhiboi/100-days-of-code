##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Learned how position works in css and the stacking context

**Thoughts:** I was confused from a long time how the positions... I had a rough idea of that earlier but after practicing that and reading about the stacking context now it's clear....
